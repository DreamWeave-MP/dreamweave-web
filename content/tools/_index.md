# Explanation

The following pages are how-to guides and tips for each app in DreamWeave's toolkit.  

For first-time installers, you can get all these tools out of the [Sixth House Mod Cache](https://github.com/DreamWeave-MP/Sixth-House-Mod-Cache/releases/latest).  

For updaters, grab them directly from the [latest DW-tools release](https://github.com/DreamWeave-MP/DW-tools/releases/latest).  

Please be sure to replace or overwrite any existing files when updating DW-Tools!
