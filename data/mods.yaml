    description: |-
      Portable mannequins which can be equipped with weapons and armor, and posed in about ten positions.
      I know there are other mannequin mods, but I wasn't happy with any that I tried. If you feel the same way, give mine a try.
      Visit the shop in Caldera to get started. Now with wigs!
